    <h2> This calculator measure if you have reacher your caffeine limit for the day.</h2>
    <h3>The biological half-life of caffeine in typical adults is between 5 to 6 hours. This means if you had 100 grams of caffeine, you would have around 50 grams after 5 hours.
    Keep in mind that after the amount becomes very small, it is likely that the body will dispose of it all at once rather than halving the amount forever. For a single dose, health authorities recommended that you consume no more than 200 mg of caffeine at one time. Recommendations for caffeine levels are for 18 years of age or over.</h3> <br>
    <h3> Based on the average human body weight worldwide7,  research concludes that generally 6 mg/kg (of weight) is appropriate for those with normal sensitivity to the caffeine molecule. </h3> <br>
